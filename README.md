120-Arduino-I2C-and-Wire-Library
================================

In this course we will learn how to communicate to any of the hundreds of I2C device using the Wire.h library. 



We have 3 Projects, we will start with standard sensors and those who have more time
can go ahead and hack different sensors into their module.

Project 1  ->  Project 2 ->  Project 3
Any Sensor -> Recording  ->  BLE
Any Sensor -> Displaying ->  BLE
