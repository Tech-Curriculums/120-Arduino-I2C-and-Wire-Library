120-Arduino-I2C-and-Wire-Library
================================

In this course we will learn how to communicate to any of the hundreds of I2C device using the Wire.h library. 



We have 3 Projects, we will start with standard sensors and those who have more time
can go ahead and hack different sensors into their module.

| Project 1  |  Project 2 |  Project 3 | 
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Any Sensor | Recording  | BLE | 
| Any Sensor | Displaying |  BLE |

Feel free to voltron everything -- such is the joy of I2C!
